            Here are 4 of the most popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on
            job

            <h2>Python</h2>
            Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large
            library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and
            C++.
            In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot
            of
            computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming
            language,
            especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.

            Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server
            applications,
            which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming
            language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a
            result,
            Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.
